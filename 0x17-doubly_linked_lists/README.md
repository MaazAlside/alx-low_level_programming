# README for "0x17. C - Doubly linked lists"

This repository is a part of the "0x17. C - Doubly linked lists" project and contains C code for working with doubly linked lists. The project focuses on learning and implementing operations on doubly linked lists and is a part of the ALX Low-Level Programming curriculum.

## Learning Objectives

Upon completing this project, you should be able to:

- Understand what a doubly linked list is.
- Implement various operations on doubly linked lists, including insertion and deletion.
- Follow a coding style guide, in this case, the Betty style.
- Avoid plagiarism and practice good coding ethics.

## Project Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5.
- All code files should end with a newline.
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory.
- Code should follow the Betty style.
- Avoid using global variables.
- No more than 5 functions per file.
- Allowed C standard library functions are `malloc`, `free`, `printf`, and `exit`.
- Prototypes of all functions should be included in a header file named `lists.h`.

## Tasks

1. **Print list**: Implement a function that prints all the elements of a `dlistint_t` list.

2. **List length**: Create a function that returns the number of elements in a linked `dlistint_t` list.

3. **Add node**: Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a `dlistint_t` list.

4. **Add node at the end**: Implement a function that adds a new node at the end of a `dlistint_t` list.

5. **Free list**: Create a function that frees a `dlistint_t` list.

6. **Get node at index**: Implement a function that returns the nth node of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

7. **Sum list**: Write a function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a `dlistint_t` linked list.

8. **Insert at index**: Create a function that inserts a new node at a given position in a `dlistint_t` list.

9. **Delete at index**: Implement a function that deletes the node at a given index in a `dlistint_t` linked list.

10. **Crackme4 (Advanced)**: Find the password for the crackme4 program and save it in the file `100-password`.

11. **Palindromes (Advanced)**: Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers and save it in the file `102-result`.

12. **Crackme5 (Advanced)**: Write a keygen for the crackme5 program that prints a valid key for a given username.

Each task corresponds to a C file in this repository. The code for each task can be found in its respective file.

## How to Use

To compile and run the C code for each task, you can use the provided examples and the associated `main` function in the C file.

Example:

```shell
gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 0-main.c 0-print_dlistint.c -o 0-print_dlistint
./0-print_dlistint
```

Replace the C file and executable names with the appropriate task numbers to compile and run the other tasks.

Please note that this README is a summary and does not contain detailed information on each task. You should refer to the individual C files for code implementation and specifics of each task. Good luck with your "0x17. C - Doubly linked lists" project!
